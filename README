Scripts created by Andrew Schurer 22/03/2021
These scripts are written in a mix of python3 and shell.
To run the scripts requires several python packages, in particular the iris package:
https://scitools-iris.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
The scripts were designed to run in a linux environement. 
Some of the pathnames will have to be modified if running it in Windows.

To run the scripts requires the user to create a main directory which includes the directories:
CMIP5, CMIP6, CESM_LME, PAGES2K, Volcanic

In each of the model directories (CMIP5, CMIP6, CESM_LME) the user must create a RAWDATA directory.
The RAWDATA directories need to be filled with the model data listed in MODELDATA.txt

Alternatively the global mean surface air temperature timeseries can be downloaded and placed in the SavedModelData folder.
To produce the figure using these files the Process_CMIP5.sh, Process_CMIP6.sh and Process_CESM.sh scripts don't need to be run.
And processMODDATA in plot_past1000.py should be set to False

The PAGES2K directory must contain the 7 text reconstruction files downlaoded from:
https://figshare.com/collections/Global_mean_temperature_reconstructions_over_the_Common_Era/4507043
BHM.txt, CPS.txt, DA.txt, M08.txt, OIE.txt, PAI.txt, PCR.txt

The Volcanic directory needs to contain three directories.
CMIP6, Gao, Crowley, and each must contain the relenvent volcainc reconstruction.

Once the directory structure is set-up and all the datasets are downloaded, create the figure with the command.
